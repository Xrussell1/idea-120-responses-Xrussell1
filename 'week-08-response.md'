This was a very interesting chapter tackling the dangers of ads that you may find harmless actually can be detrimental to the
less fortunate. This chapter covers ways, ads hide as websites or collage that you may think is there to help but their only goal is to
exploit and extort you. It was troubling to hear the types of people these ads target. They target “isolated,” “impatient” individuals with
“low self-esteem” who have “few people in their lives who care about them”. These are the people who need the most assistance but ads are
used as a tool through WMDs as ways to profit of people that will only destroy their lives even more in the future. 

Many may argue that all ads are not bad, and this problem has picked up some national exposure by companies being sued for this injustice.
But I argue not enough has been done and the internet would be more useful without these methods. When someone goes to the internet they should
not be bombarded with ads that require you to purchase certain things. I argue this creates bad spending habits and WMDs know of this that is
why they are being specifically targeted.  I also do not think it is a good idea to direct users, if someone is doing research on the internet
their mind should be set on what they are researching it shouldn't be tainted with ads and other online content.  The predatory ads target the 
less fortunate so deleting it all together will help these vulnerable individuals not fall into a deeper hole.
