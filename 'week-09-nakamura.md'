What I think about the statement "interactive media ask us to identify with someone elseâ€™s mental structure" is to be understood in
a way that you are supposed to submit yourself in this realm of media for its success because it is structured around both your own mental
and social structure. To further understand this response one can look at how media interfaces are ubiquitous "means of accessing media 
of all kinds; their work enters the public sphere and public culture; thus, their modes of instantiating identities become of interest." 
The computer programmer's interest is to relate to the consumer that can be by their race, gender, or what they may be interested in but 
when you are interacting with this form of media you are submitting yourself in their mental structure. 

When I use TikTok I undoubtedly feel I am immersing myself in someone's mental structure other than my own. TikTok is an app that 
bases itself around the user seeing what they like or dislike, seeing what was entertaining enough to share with their friends. Many 
individuals think liking something on the app has no effect it often has a large one because this form of interactive media is learning
more about you through the accounts you choose to interact with, Soon they will know your likes or dislikes and then structure your 
TikTok webpage around this ideal that they built over time. Mental structures and social structures are represented and arranged in 
digital games and Web sites on the Internet in this case Tiktok. Therefore the interface can see what demographic category you may fit 
into and see what will be the most appealing to the user.
