Before reading this chapter on " The Problem With Video Games" I had no idea it was exclusive to one group of individuals 
who make the game and purchase and play them. The chapter raises concerning problems with this and why these problems need to be
addressed. First of which is maybe everyone doesn't like the types of games that are on the market, maybe individuals see the games
as sexes or violent. In many cases they are, so the question is where do the individuals that may want to start video games as a
hobby don't want these types of things in the game at all, where do they go?
This is the question this chapter tackles and why they called for a change in the video game industry. 

Does this present the solution why doesn't everyone has the ability to create their own video game comprised of 
their own hobbies and experiences? Doing this will reach many more demographic and social groups than video games currently do. 
As the chapter mentions a lot of these games will be mediocre with the talent gap between a video game programmer and your 
average day hobbyist. But what you will achieve will be far greater because many individuals have an alternative to the popular 
violent or sexes game that is currently on the market that time.  Games from hobbyists have the potential to change the dominant 
format of the videogame: instead of seventy-hour multimillion-dollar games that sell for sixty bucks apiece. 

If we make video-game programming accessible to the public and inform them they don't need a computer science degree 
in order to create games the biggest battle is already won. Many people will not consider this idea because a sense of 
difficulty is attached to how games are made. Although a fair amount of coding is sometimes required to program a game there are
more programs and apps like twine to bypass this coding and make gameplay easier and allow anyone and everyone with the ability 
to create it.  

If this ideology is adopted by the gaming world why can't it be utilized by others? If everyone can be a video game 
developer and programmer why can't they be authors or directors? I say they can be and if they do they will diminish the same 
problems we have seen in the past when gaming developers target one audience. If ways to create and publish books and paths to
present stories in live-action to an audience are made easier and less time-consuming more ordinary people will participate. 
In doing so they will touch a wider audience and give more consumers the ability to buy something that relates to them.
