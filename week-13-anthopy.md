This reading raised many questions like the difficulty of one hacking a game and is it a talent 
that can be inclusive to everyone, Has litigation laws ever been a problem recoding a game and my final question which 
I will focus on for this response where can the line be drawn when referencing the original script to make a new video game.
Many games become popular for their originality, new games present new rules and new ways to interact with the game 
that has not been seen before. Consumers always want the next best thing. When these popular games become mainstream game
developers are challenged to make the game structured around the type of people that purchase them. In return, this makes 
the games tailored to a specific audience such as men or a certain racial demographic such as white males. Chapter 4 presents 
a way of modifying things in the game you may not like, such as the sex of the character or even changing the goal of the game.

Chapter four covers original games being hacked and coded for individuals to modify their own version of the game.
It is often the original video game developers won't make changes to games or a sequel if it doesn't get much exposure because 
they will have to pay production and manufacturing costs to get the game out.  That provides opportunities for a private 
company to go in and make their own version of the game referencing the original script by hacking and modifying the code and 
just changing the name of the game. I argue this is taking away from the original gameplay and what it was trying to achieve. 

What my question is where does the line be drawn. While going into software to change the game can be beneficial
to what you wish the game could be, using the same script and just modifying it is too close to the original, in my
opinion. The game can be played for personal enjoyment, but when it is sold or uploaded to the internet for others 
to play, I think there needs to be a line drawn. By referencing the original game and stealing many techniques and 
designs from it, the original owner is disrespected and the integrity of the game is compromised.
. My statement is not implying all modifications are bad. For instance, original games can be modified to translate the 
language for users from other countries so they can enjoy the game. The modification only becomes detrimental when the
original game is almost copied and just has a different title. Seeing other people's critiques of minor things seems 
out of place, and it takes away from the vision the original coder had for the game.
