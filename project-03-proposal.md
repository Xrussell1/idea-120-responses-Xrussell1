I've thought about this proposal for quite a while even though I completed the reading on non-linear narratives it was difficult to
reach a decision. So I thought about video games that I've played in the past that can be integrated into this interactive medium. 
In this game the reader would be the player in this choose their own adventure game,  deciding how to navigate through a haunted 
house with a significant other. This game will tackle sensitive subjects like mental illness, social anxiety, and most of all peer
pressure. It would be a challenge to see if another person's decisions will alter your own while making decisions to go to the next 
step. The goal of the reader for this game will be to experience reading the game into one that spirals inward rather than moving 
forward. In other words, by making the game nonlinear your decisions will further get you immersed into the problems of getting 
through the haunted house rather than escaping it. You will not know what action will lead you next, which will ultimately make it 
non-linear and in my opinion very interactive. My hope for the reader during this game is to find at least one thing about there self. 
Also to enjoy reading the interactive game by being surprised by each decision you make.
