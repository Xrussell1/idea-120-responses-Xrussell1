Three messages are held in a visual advertisement are linguistic, symbolic, or literal message. This cool medium is a
perfect example of all three. The reason why I suggest this image is a cool medium rather than hot is that it requires
participation because knowledge of what a “Mac” is will be needed to decipher the image. The image is directed toward anyone
who has had McDonald's, individuals that hadn’t will not understand the advertisement. Therefore the sandwich stands for a 
literal and a symbolic meaning because it is signifying that the big mac sandwich is good for people to eat while working. 
It is important to note that the sandwich is the signifier because this lets the audience know the primary focus is the 
sandwich, the denoted message the ad poster is trying to portray is that the sandwich is good for working individuals directing 
their focus on office workers we know this because the first text we notice says "Brain food". The linguistic message linking the 
text and image together is the similar titles of the items. Which is the sandwich named Big Mac and the computer name is macintosh 
which is abbreviated to "Mac". By the two names relating to each other, it forms a linguistic message because this allows the text 
and image to agree with each other.
