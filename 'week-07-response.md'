I honestly think Bridle is blowing this situation out of proportion. although he provides some facts as to why he thinks the internet
has gone bad and is "weird" to children it was not enough to convince me. First, he states he is not a parent which in my eyes makes
him lose all credibility speaking on the topic. He states   
Someone or something or some combination of people and things is using YouTube to systematically frighten, traumatize, 
and abuse children, automatically and at scale. He says this but only backs it with a bunch of videos that he deems weird
but how can he know what is weird or traumatizing because he is neither the young chil watching the content nor a parent that
knows what is best for their child.  

YouTube and Google are complicit in that system bridle suggests it is their responsibility to deal with this. But with this, 
they may have to shut down all their platforms Which may cause a larger problem. So I suggest parents should just monitor what 
their kids are watching just as they do with everything else they do at this young age.
