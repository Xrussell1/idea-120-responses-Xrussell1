Some of her suggestions have made some traction. Such as her "Mobile device‚Äù idea. Netflix has recently experienced 
interactive films, these films did exactly what Murray predicted which was the viewer can alter the pace and decisions
in the movie. A 2018 film called Bandersnatch did exactly this allowing the viewer to change the story allowing dramatic 
action that you made look like any ordinary tv show. 

Murray's prediction comparing to hyper-realistic virtual environments are perfectly aligned 
with the action and production of the Disney + show the Mandalorian.  Murray predicted in the future of 
hyper serial format a virtual set design would be an extension of the dialogue and dramatic action, depending 
on the immersive illusion of the story. With the Mandalorian set, the design was innovated from green screens to make
the videography more defined with the lighting making the actor seem to be in the space they are filming, making an illusion 
with the set design.  This gave the ability for the actor to know where they are looking and giving them a sense that they were 
immersed in this imaginary space.
