The main project I'll show for my final portfolio project is the final project where I created a interactive non-linear game. 
I really want to surround my portfolio with the project because it really encapsulates what I have learned in this course.
I will provide the different designs used for each project, they will vary in many different style sheets to keep the viewer
interested. This will be done witl utlizing a photoshop software, I beive this will  be the factor to make my ptoject intresting rather than
a dull viewing of my work I've completed this semseter in the course.
I want to showcase my skills with HTML /CSS while simultaneously showing many hidden details within my project. 
I will offer screenshots for each project making it a style sheet in order to show each project.
